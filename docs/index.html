          The first trajectory shows a cloud particle (the blue circle) that is caught in the core of 
          the updraft which is vaulted up to the anvil and lost to the system. The second trajectory
          shows the successful growth of a large hailstone. It starts with another small cloud particle
          (the white circle) that is caught, this time, in the edge of the updraft. The edge of the updraft
          is not as strong as the core, so the particle remains in the system. The particle then falls into
          a region of weak updrafts called the embryo curtain. This particle can now be considered an embryo,
          the basis of a hailstone. From there, the embryo reenters the main updraft once more and grows into
          a hailstone during a single up, then down trajectory, aided by the downdraft. The closer the 
          hailstone's fall speed is to the speed of the updraft, the longer it will remain in the growth
          region (-40°C - 0C°),and the larger the hydrometeor will become. Refresh the page to view the 
          animation as many times as you'd like.
